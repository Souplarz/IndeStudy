## Overview of Independent Study
</div>

<br>

*This independent study will expand on material illustration techniques and methods learned while taking ‘Illustrating Botanicals” in the fall of 2024; in addition to building on specific skills related to now familiar mediums of colored pencil and watercolor, digital art techniques will be introduced, and basic methods for composing page layouts will be practiced. A series of projects throughout the semester, building in technical complexity, will focus on utilizing these more advanced image-making skills; subject matter will revolve around my personal research on poplar trees in the Keller Lab. The aim will be to develop aesthetically attractive visual materials that effectively and accurately communicate certain facets of this research to non-specialist audiences.* <br>

*This platform will be used to keep track of all submissions through out the semester and allow for comments and feedback to be provided on submitted work and drafts.*
